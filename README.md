# Graph_algorithms

Welcome to the repository for the Graph algorithms course laboratories! This repository contains the implementation of 3 laboratory exercises designed to reinforce the understanding of graphs algorithms and their applications.

# 🗂️Lab1
Design and implement an abstract data type-directed graph and a function for reading a directed graph from a text file.

The functionalities are as follows:
- Number of Vertices
- Iterate through Vertices
- Check Edge Existence and Retrieve Edge ID
- In-Degree and Out-Degree of a Vertex
- Iterate Outbound Edges of a Vertex
- Iterate Inbound Edges of a Vertex
- Endpoints of an Edge
- Retrieve or Modify Edge Information
- Add and Remove Edges and Vertices
- Graph Copy
- Read Graph from Text File
- Write Graph to Text File
- Create Random Graph
