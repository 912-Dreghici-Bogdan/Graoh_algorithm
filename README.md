# Graph_algorithms

Welcome to the repository for the Graph algorithms course laboratories! This repository contains the implementation of 4 laboratory exercises designed to reinforce the understanding of graphs algorithms and their applications.

### 🗂️Lab1
Design and implement an abstract data type-directed graph and a function for reading a directed graph from a text file.

The functionalities are as follows:
- Number of Vertices;
- Iterate through Vertices;
- Check Edge Existence and Retrieve Edge ID;
- In-Degree and Out-Degree of a Vertex;
- Iterate Outbound Edges of a Vertex;
- Iterate Inbound Edges of a Vertex;
- Endpoints of an Edge;
- Retrieve or Modify Edge Information;
- Add and Remove Edges and Vertices;
- Graph Copy;
- Read Graph from Text File;
- Write Graph to Text File;
- Create a Random Graph.

### 🗂️Lab2
Implementation of a function that finds the connected components of an undirected graph using a breadth-first traversal of the graph.

### 🗂️Lab3
Write a function to be integrated into the already existing console-based application that finds the lowest cost path between 2 vertices.

### 🗂️Lab4
Write a program that, given a graph with costs, does the following:
- verify if the corresponding graph is a DAG and performs a topological sorting of the activities using the algorithm based on predecessor counters;
- if it is a DAG, finds a highest cost path between two given vertices, in O(m+n).
